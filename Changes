1.0-1:
	- Fixed type of swR_names so runs in R >= 2.4.0
	- Rearranged some directories under inst to conform
	  to conventions.
	- Placed chm and check directories under inst. The chm will be
	  created for Windows in CRAN. Needed to rename both, otherwise
	  the two directories were deleted.
	- Removed .so, .o, and .dll from src, as well as Makefile.
	- Fixed newlines of sw.c (now Unix style, so no warnings with
	  check).
